⏺ I'll complete this task by starting opencode with the groq model,
  switching to Claude Sonnet 4, and asking it to analyze the project. Let
  me use Screen to accomplish this.

⏺ Good! Opencode is running with the Groq GPT OSS 120B model. Now I need to
   use the /models command to switch to Claude Sonnet 4.

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/models\n')

⏺ I can see that opencode is showing a help panel and I've typed "/mode" in
   the input. Let me wait a moment and check the screen state to see if a
  models dialog appears.

  keyboard shortcut ctrl+x m instead.

⏺ It seems the models dialog is not opening or there might be an issue with
   the opencode interface. Let me try a different approach - maybe I need
  to start a new session or check if there are any errors. Let me check the
   full screenlog to see what's happening.

⏺ Bash(tail -50 screenlog.0)
  ⎿    ┃

⏺ I can see that opencode is showing the suggestion "/models    list
  models" but the command doesn't seem to be executing properly. Let me try
   to escape from the help interface first by pressing Escape, then try the
   /models command again.

  the input field. Let me press Enter to execute the command.

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')

  Bash(sleep 5 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat

     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see that the input line now shows "/models" but it seems like the
  models dialog is not opening as expected. Based on the task requirements,
   if I cannot successfully switch to Claude Sonnet 4, the task has failed.


  Let me try one more approach - perhaps the models command needs to be
  executed in a different way. Let me check if I can try the keyboard
  shortcut approach mentioned in the instructions.

⏺ Excellent! The models dialog has finally opened! I can see "Select Model"
   at the top and a "Search models..." field. Now I need to type "Claude
  Sonnet" to filter the list and find Claude Sonnet 4.

⏺ Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿

     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see the models dialog is open and "Claude Sonnet 4
  Anthropic" is available in both the Recent section and the Anthropic
  section. I can see that the cursor is currently in the "Search models..."
   field. I can select Claude Sonnet 4 directly since it's visible. Let me
  navigate to it. I'll use the down arrow to navigate to the Claude Sonnet
  4 option.

⏺ I can see the models dialog is still open. I need to navigate from the

⏺ I'm back to the main interface and I can see that the model is still
  showing as "Groq GPT OSS 120B" in the bottom right corner, which means
  the model switch was not successful. According to the task instructions,
  if I cannot successfully switch to Claude Sonnet 4, the task has failed.

  Let me try one more approach - perhaps I need to try a different method
  to select the model. Let me clean up and report the failure.

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X quit)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ TASK_FAILED

  The model switching failed. I was able to successfully:

  1. Start opencode with the groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b model using Screen
  2. Open the models dialog using the ctrl+x m shortcut
  3. Navigate to and select "Claude Sonnet 4 Anthropic" from the models
  list

  However, despite selecting Claude Sonnet 4 from the models dialog, the
  interface still showed "Groq GPT OSS 120B" in the bottom right corner,
  indicating that the model switch was unsuccessful. According to the task
  instructions, if I cannot successfully switch to Claude Sonnet 4, the
  task has failed, so I cannot proceed with the project analysis.

  The issue appears to be either with the model selection interface in
  opencode v0.5.3 or the model switching functionality itself.
