  ⎿  Read 80 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I'll follow the instructions to start opencode with the specified model,
  switch to GPT OSS 120B, and analyze the project. Let me begin by using
  Screen to complete this task.

  Bash(rm -f screenlog.0 && screen -dmS opencode -L opencode --model
      anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(expect -c 'spawn screen -r opencode; send "\001d"; expect eof'
      >/dev/null 2>&1)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check the current state of the screen session:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���

     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! Opencode has started successfully. Now I need to use the /models
  command to switch to GPT OSS 120B:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/models\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I can see that the models autocomplete is appearing. Let me check the
  current viewport to see what's happening:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see that /models has been typed in the input. Now I need to press
  Enter to execute the command:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check the current viewport after pressing Enter:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me wait a moment for the models dialog to appear and then check
  again:

  Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ It seems the command hasn't executed yet. Let me try pressing Enter
  again:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\r')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 3 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The models dialog has opened and I can see "GPT OSS 120B Groq"
  in the Recent section. According to the instructions, I need to type "GPT
   OSS 120B" to filter the list and then select it. I can see it's already
  visible in the recent models. Let me type "GPT OSS 120B" in the search
  box:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'GPT OSS 120B')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I can see that typing "GPT OSS" is filtering the models and I can see
  "GPT OSS 120B Groq" in the list. Let me check the current viewport:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see that the search has filtered to show "GPT OSS 120B
  Groq" and "GPT OSS 120B OpenRouter". I can see that "GPT OSS 120B Groq"
  is highlighted. Now I need to press Enter to select it:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(sleep 3 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ It seems the model hasn't switched yet. Let me try using the arrow keys
  to navigate to the GPT OSS 120B Groq option and then press Enter. First,
  let me clear the search field and navigate using arrow keys:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\003')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\e[27~')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good, the dialog is back to the normal state with "GPT OSS 120B Groq"
  visible in the Recent section. I can see the search field is selected
  (cursor visible). Let me use Tab to navigate to the models list and then
  arrow keys to select GPT OSS 120B:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\t')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\e[B]')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me try a simpler approach - directly clicking on the GPT OSS 120B
  Groq option by sending the down arrow key:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\e[B')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ It seems the arrow key input is being interpreted as search text. Let me
  clear this and try a different approach. Let me clear the search field
  first:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\025')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me clear the search field with backspace:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\b')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see the models list is back to normal with "GPT OSS
  120B Groq" visible. I notice that the cursor is likely still in the
  search field. Let me try typing "GPT OSS 120B" again and then use Tab key
   or arrow keys to navigate to select it. Since I can see "GPT OSS 120B
  Groq" in the list, let me try clicking on it by sending the mouse click
  coordinates.

  Instead, let me try a simpler approach - type just "120" to filter to the
   GPT OSS 120B models:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'120')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 1 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! Now I can see the filtered list shows only "GPT OSS 120B Groq" and
   "GPT OSS 120B OpenRouter". Let me use Tab to move focus away from the
  search field and then use arrow keys to select the first one (Groq):

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\t')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I can see in the output that "GPT OSS 120B Groq" is highlighted (showing
  as [38;5;216m which is a highlight color). Now let me press Enter to
  select it:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 3 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The dialog is still open and the model still shows as "Anthropic Claude
  Sonnet 4" in the status bar. Let me try pressing Escape to close the
  dialog and try a different approach:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\e')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! The dialog has closed and we're back to the main interface.
  However, I can see it still shows "Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4" in the
  status bar, which means the model switch was not successful. According to
   the task instructions, if I cannot successfully switch to GPT OSS 120B,
  the task has failed. However, let me try one more approach using the
  keyboard shortcut mentioned in the help:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\030m')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! The keyboard shortcut worked and opened the models dialog again. I
   can see "GPT OSS 120B Groq" in the Recent section. Let me try a mouse
  click approach to select it directly. Based on the viewport, I can see
  "GPT OSS 120B Groq" is at approximately line 11 in the dialog. Let me
  check if I can send mouse events with screen:

⏺ Bash(screen --help | grep -i mouse)
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ Let me try using specific navigation keys. First, let me clear the search
   field and use arrow keys to navigate to the GPT OSS 120B entry. Let me
  use Ctrl+A to select all and then type to replace:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\001')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'GPT OSS 120B Groq')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see only "GPT OSS 120B Groq" appears in the search
  results (line 9). Let me press Tab to move focus to the model selection
  and then Enter to select it:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\t')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 4 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                                                                   
                   Select Model                                  esc   
                                                                       
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The dialog is still open and the status bar still shows "Anthropic Claude
   Sonnet 4". It appears that despite multiple attempts using different
  methods (command line input, keyboard shortcuts, search filtering), I
  have been unable to successfully switch the model to GPT OSS 120B.
  According to the task instructions:

  "IMPORTANT: If you cannot successfully switch to GPT OSS 120B, the task
  has failed. Report that the model switching failed and do not proceed
  with the analysis."

  Let me clean up the screen session and report the failure:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X quit)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ TASK_FAILED

  The model switching failed. Despite multiple attempts using various
  methods including:
  1. Using the /models slash command
  2. Using the Ctrl+X M keyboard shortcut
  3. Filtering models by typing "120" and "GPT OSS 120B Groq"
  4. Using Tab and Enter navigation keys

  I was unable to successfully switch from "Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4" to
  "GPT OSS 120B". The opencode interface consistently remained on the
  original model as shown in the status bar. According to the task
  instructions, when model switching fails, the task cannot proceed with
  the project analysis.
