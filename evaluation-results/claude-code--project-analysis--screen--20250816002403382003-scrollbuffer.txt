  ject-analysis--screen--20250816002403382003-prompt.md and follow the

⏺ I'll read the file and follow the instructions.

⏺ I'll follow the instructions to start opencode with the specified model,
  switch to GPT OSS 120B, and have it analyze the project. I'll use Screen
  to complete this task.

⏺ Great! OpenCode has started successfully. Now I'll use the /models
  command to switch to GPT OSS 120B.

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/models\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I see that the /models command has been typed. Let me wait a moment and
  check the screen to see if the models dialog has opened.

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)

   to execute it.

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)

⏺ I can see that the interface is showing the /models command in the input
  field. Let me wait a moment and then check again to see if the models
  dialog has opened or if I need to trigger it differently.

⏺ Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat

⏺ It seems the /models command isn't triggering a dialog as expected. Let
  me try using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+X M as mentioned in the
  interface.

   try again with just "/models".

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\003')

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)

⏺ I need to clear the input field completely. Let me try backspacing to
  remove the characters and try again.

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)

     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! Now the input field is clear. Let me try typing "/models" again:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/models')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Great! I can see that the command autocomplete is working and showing
  /models as an option. Let me check the current screen more clearly:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see "/models" is now in the input field. Let me press
  Enter to execute the command:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 3 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ It seems the models dialog is not opening as expected. Let me try a
  different approach and check the screen logs to see if anything is
  happening in the background:

⏺ Bash(tail -20 screenlog.0)
  ⎿                        █░░█ █░░█ █▀▀ █░░█ █░░
      █░░█ █░░█ █▀▀                      
                           ▀▀▀▀ █▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀ ▀▀▀
     … +42 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The models dialog doesn't seem to be opening. Let me try a different
  approach - maybe the command needs to be sent with Enter after it and let
   me try just clicking on the /models line to see if it works:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\003')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me try a different approach. Since the /models command doesn't seem
  to be working as expected to open a dialog, let me check if there's a way
   to switch models directly. First, let me see if there are any other ways
   to access models:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/help\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(sleep 2 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the command got concatenated. Let me clear this and try a different
   approach. Based on the task description, it seems like the /models
  command should open a dialog where I can filter and select "GPT OSS
  120B". Since the command interface seems to have issues, let me check if
  the model switch is even possible by first trying to execute the current
  command as is:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\003')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ It seems like the task expects me to be able to switch to "GPT OSS 120B"
  but this model might not be available in this OpenCode installation.
  According to the task instructions, if I cannot successfully switch to
  GPT OSS 120B, the task has failed. Let me try to clear the input and
  attempt one more time to see if I can access the models list properly:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Good, now the input field is clear. Let me try the Tab key to see if that
   triggers autocomplete for /models:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'/m\t')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I can see the autocomplete showing /models. Let me click or select it:

⏺ Bash(screen -S opencode -X stuff $'odels\n')
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(sleep 3 && screen -S opencode -p 0 -X hardcopy output.txt && cat
      output.txt)
  ⎿                        ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� ���� ��� ���� ���� ���
                           ���� ���� ��� �  � ��� ���� ���  ���
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see "odels" in the input field. This is not working as expected.
  Based on my repeated attempts to use the /models command and the
  interface behavior, it appears that the models dialog is not functioning
  properly or the "GPT OSS 120B" model is not available in this OpenCode
  installation.

  According to the task instructions: "IMPORTANT: If you cannot
  successfully switch to GPT OSS 120B, the task has failed. Report that the
   model switching failed and do not proceed with the analysis."

  Let me clean up and terminate the session:

  Bash(screen -S opencode -X quit)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ TASK_FAILED

  The model switching failed. Despite multiple attempts to use the /models
  command in OpenCode, I was unable to access the models dialog or switch
  to "GPT OSS 120B". The /models command did not open a functional dialog
  where I could filter and select the specified model. This could be due
  to:

  1. The GPT OSS 120B model not being available in this OpenCode
  installation
  2. Issues with the /models command interface functionality
  3. The model dialog not working properly in the current environment

  Since I cannot successfully switch to GPT OSS 120B as required by the
  task instructions, the task has failed and I did not proceed with the
  project analysis.
