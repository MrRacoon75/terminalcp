⏺ Excellent! I can see at the bottom that the model has been successfully
  switched to "Groq GPT OSS 120B". Now I'll prompt it to analyze the
  project by reading README.md:

⏺ Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode "Read README.md explain what this project
       does" Enter)

    … +28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ I can see the response is in progress. Let me wait a bit more and then
  capture the full scrollback to get the complete response:

⏺ Bash(sleep 3)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S -)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md

    … +28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ The response appears to be incomplete. Let me scroll up to capture the
  beginning of the response, as the task requires capturing the COMPLETE
  response:

⏺ Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode "PageUp" "PageUp" "PageUp" "PageUp"
      "PageUp")
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +39 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ I can see the prompt and the beginning of the response. Let me scroll
  down to see more of the response:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode "PageDown" "PageDown")
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me continue scrolling to capture the complete response. Let me use a
  different approach and capture a larger section using the -S parameter:

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S -50)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ It seems the response is still being processed or may be cut off. Let me
  try to scroll to the very end to see if there's more:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode "End")
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me capture the complete buffer more comprehensively by getting all
  lines from the start:

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S -100)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me try scrolling up to find the complete beginning of the response
  and then work my way down to capture it all:

⏺ Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode "Home")
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me try a different approach and capture the full history from the
  start of the session:

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S - | head -100)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me try getting the full history differently:

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -e -p -S -)
  ⎿                                
       ┃  # Explaining project fro
     m README.md
     … +47 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The output is truncated and showing escape sequences. Let me try a more
  direct approach to capture the conversation history step by step. Let me
  scroll all the way up and then navigate down to capture the complete
  response:

⏺ Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode C-Home)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S -200)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me try getting the history buffer more directly and see if there's
  more complete conversation available:

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p -S -)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ I notice the response appears to be incomplete and cut off at "AI
  Collaboration: run other AI tools (Claude, Gemini, etc.) as". Let me try
  to see if there's more content or if the model is still processing by
  waiting and checking again:

⏺ Bash(sleep 10)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ The response appears to be cut off. Let me try using pgup and pgdown to
  navigate through the full conversation to see if there's more content I
  missed:

⏺ Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageUp PageUp PageUp PageUp PageUp)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +38 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Good! Now I can see the beginning. Let me scroll down gradually to
  capture the complete response in sections:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageDown)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +33 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Great! Now I'm getting more of the response. Let me continue scrolling
  down:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageDown)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md

      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +31 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Continuing to scroll down to get the rest:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageDown)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md

    … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me continue to get the rest of the response:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageDown)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md                               
          ┃
      ┃  /share to create a shareable link                    22.9K/17% ($0
    … +32 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Let me continue to get the end of the response:

  Bash(tmux send-keys -t opencode PageDown)
  ⎿  (No content)

  Bash(tmux capture-pane -t opencode -p)
  ⎿   ┃  # Explaining project from README.md

    … +28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Perfect! Now I have captured the complete response from GPT OSS 120B. Let
   me clean up by killing the tmux session:

  Bash(tmux kill-session -t opencode)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ TASK_COMPLETE

  I successfully completed the task. Here's the complete response from GPT
  OSS 120B when asked to analyze the project by reading README.md:

  Complete GPT OSS 120B Analysis:

  Project Overview – terminalcp

  terminalcp is a Node-JS library and CLI that lets AI agents (or any
  program) control interactive command-line tools just like a human would.
  It provides a "Playwright-for-the-terminal"-style interface that can:

  • Spawn and manage any CLI process (debuggers, REPLs, build tools, etc.)
  in a pseudo-TTY.
  • Send keystrokes, special keys, and control sequences to those
  processes.
  • Read output either as a full rendered screen (for TUIs, debuggers,
  etc.) or as a raw stream (for logs, builds, etc.).
  • Run multiple sessions simultaneously, with each session persisting
  across client disconnects.
  • Allow users to attach to AI-spawned sessions (like screen/tmux) to
  watch or intervene.

  Key Features

  • Debugging: drive LLDB, GDB, pdb, etc., step-by-step.
  • AI Collaboration: run other AI tools (Claude, Gemini, etc.) as
  subprocesses.
  • REPL & Shell Interaction: Python, Node, Ruby, database shells, etc.
  • Process Management: start, stop, list, and kill sessions via JSON
  commands (MCP) or a CLI.
  • Two output modes:
    • Terminal mode (stdout) – full screen with colors, ideal for TUIs.
    • Stream mode (stream) – raw output, optionally incremental and
  ANSI-stripped.
  • MCP Server: exposes a single terminalcp tool that accepts JSON actions
  (start, stdin, stdout, stream, stop, etc.).
  • CLI: terminalcp start|stop|attach|stdout|stream|... for manual use.
  • Programmatic API (TerminalManager) for driving terminals from code
  (e.g., tests, automation).

  Architecture

  1. TerminalManager – core PTY manager (node-pty + xterm.js) handling I/O
  and terminal emulation.
  2. TerminalServer – background process that holds sessions, communicates
  via a Unix socket.
  3. TerminalClient – used by both the MCP server and CLI to talk to the
  server.
  4. User Interfaces – MCP server (for AI agents) and CLI (for humans) both
   use the same underlying client.

  Typical Use Cases

  • AI-driven debugging (LLDB, GDB).
  • Running and monitoring builds.
  • Automated testing of TUIs (vim, htop, etc.).
  • Collaborative AI sessions where multiple users can attach to the same
  terminal.

  In short, terminalcp provides a robust, programmable way for AI agents
  (or any code) to spawn, control, and monitor interactive terminal
  applications, with both programmatic and CLI interfaces.
