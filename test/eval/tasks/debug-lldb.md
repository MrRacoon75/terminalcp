# Debug Analysis with LLDB

The program `evaluation/demo-buggy` crashes when executed. Use the tool mentioned above to control LLDB to:
- Start the program under the debugger
- Identify where and why it crashes
- Examine variables, memory, and call stack
- Do NOT look at source code files
- Report the root cause of the crash

IMPORTANT: When you have successfully identified the crash reason and explained it, output exactly "TASK_COMPLETE" on its own line.
If you determine you cannot complete the task, output exactly "TASK_FAILED" on its own line.
