Start a Python REPL and complete these steps:

1. Calculate 42 * 17 and verify the result appears
2. Import math module and calculate math.factorial(10)
3. Create list comprehension: [x**2 for x in range(10)]
4. Define a function that checks if a number is prime (enter it line by line with proper indentation)
5. Test your prime function with the number 97 and report whether it's prime
6. Exit the REPL cleanly

After each input, check the output to confirm your command executed correctly before proceeding to the next step.

Finally, get all the output and summarize the results, including whether 97 is prime.
