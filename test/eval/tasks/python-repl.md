# Python REPL Calculations

Start a Python REPL and perform these tasks in sequence:
1. Calculate 42 * 17
2. Import math module and calculate math.factorial(10)
3. Create list comprehension: [x**2 for x in range(10)]
4. Define a function that checks if a number is prime
5. Test your prime function with the number 17
6. Exit the REPL cleanly

Capture all output and results from each step.

IMPORTANT: When you have successfully completed all steps and exited the REPL, output exactly "TASK_COMPLETE" on its own line.
If you determine you cannot complete the task, output exactly "TASK_FAILED" on its own line.
