# üéõÔ∏è terminalcp - Control CLI Tools with AI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

terminalcp enables AI agents to interact with command-line tools just like a human. Imagine the power of debugging and collaboration at your fingertips, all automated for ease of use. This application helps you run processes, send keystrokes, and read output from CLI tools that usually need human input.

## üîë Key Features

- **Debugging Made Easy**: Use command-line debuggers such as LLDB, GDB, or pdb to step through your code.
- **Collaborate with AI**: Run AI tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex as subprocesses to enhance your coding experience.
- **Interactive Sessions**: Engage with REPL environments for Python, Node, or Ruby, as well as database shells and system monitors.
- **Seamless Process Control**: Manage multiple interactive CLI tools without blocking your agent.
- **Join AI-Spawned Processes**: Attach to processes started by AI agents from your own terminal, similar to tools like screen or tmux.

- **RAM**: 2 GB minimum; 4 GB recommended for better performance.
- **Storage**: At least 50 MB of free space.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the appropriate command-line tools installed. Some features may require specific dependencies like Python or Git.

## üöÄ Getting Started

After installation, follow these steps to begin using terminalcp:

1. Open your command-line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell).
2. Navigate to the directory where terminalcp is installed.
3. Run the terminalcp command to start using it.

For example, if you installed terminalcp in a folder named `terminalcp`, you would type:

```bash
cd path/to/terminalcp
./terminalcp
```

You can now use terminalcp to control your CLI tools with AI, debug code, or even collaborate using other AI tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Instructions

### 1. Starting a Process

To start interacting with a command-line tool, you can use simple commands. For instance, to launch Python's REPL, you would type:

```bash
terminalcp python
```

This command initiates a Python interactive session where an AI can assist you.

### 2. Debugging with LLDB

To begin a debugging session, run:

```bash
terminalcp lldb your_program
```

Replace `your_program` with the name of the program you wish to debug. The AI agent will take control and help you step through the process.

### 3. Collaborating with Other AI Tools

You can integrate different AI tools by running them as subprocesses. For instance:

```bash
terminalcp codex run_script.py
```

This command allows Codex to execute your Python script while you monitor the output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when running terminalcp, consider the following tips:

- **Ensure Proper Installation**: Double-check that terminalcp was installed correctly.
- **Check Dependencies**: Make sure any required command-line tools are installed and in your system's PATH.
- **Consult Logs**: Look for error messages in your terminal for guidance on what went wrong.
